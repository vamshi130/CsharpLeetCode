Dictionary---An abstract data structure stores data in the form of Key/value pair
          ---we can overwrite dioctionary values only by index method i.e obj[1]="data";


-The goal of a Hashing function is to take in a key and reliably place it somewhere in the 
 hash table so that it can be accessible
-Hash function-take the key,divide it by itself then multiply the result
               by the number of digits in the key minus 1
			   
Enumerations--------------
A enum is a userdefined type.
Better to define  an enum directly under the namespace
rather than Class or a structure.
-use
  Whenever the user wants select a perticular item from a list we can use enums
  
  -----------------------------
Variable of a class
  -class is a userdefined type
  -int is a data type
  int i=100 here  i is copy of int
  ---Non static members of a class cannot be accessible from static main class
  ---we need to make instance to use
  ---instance of class can be created only by using new keyword
  ---  ClassFirst f =new ClassFirst()=>here f is the instance of a class and instance can have its own memory and not share with any instance
       ClassFirst f1=new ClassFirst()=>here f1 is the reference of the class
	                                    reference willl not have any memory but use like instance
										it just acts like a pointer
  ---  ClassFirst f; =>here f is the variable of a class
                  f=new ClassFirst(); =>here f os instance of class
				  ---memory is allocated only for instance of a class

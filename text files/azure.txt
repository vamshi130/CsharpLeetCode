Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services
AZure fundamentals is a series of six learning paths
Cloud computing
 It's the delivery of computing services over the network
 which includes servers, storage,databases,networking
      (screentshot)
	  container engine after the hypervisor
	  in hypervisor we need to do patching ,migration and many more
	  in container we dont need to any it convert into a package 
	  hypervisor,comtainer,serverless runtime
	  serverless runtime ---function
	Cloud services Benefits
	-Scalability and elastibility
	-High Availability
    -Fault tolerance
	-Agility,customer latency capabilities
	-Disaster recovery in azure we call as service recovery
Cloud services-----	
	On-premises--we can manage when we are having data centers (i.e in our office we having total data servers or own cooling systems)
	             we are responsible for everything total         
	Iaas--like os,vms,cpu(we need to choose which os to use ) (providing servers or switches or storage or networking in high availability )ex google,aws
	             Ex.In this we are taking a a place to place our own os or middeware (the place is just like server or networking)
			   --host
	Paas--like developers,deployers
	             in this how the application is running
	Saas--like business users
	             in this they are having total responsibility
				 ex office365. 
	 
	  
-manage instance
-azure sql server	
cloud models-----
	public cloud--
	prons-
	
	private cloud--
	hybrid  cloud--
	
    Virtual machine Scale sets (VMSS)(it will increase or decrease automatically)	
	
	 whenever the cpu is using some memory i.e more then it will automatically create another vms

Azure
 Azure gives us the freedom to build ,manage and deploy applications on a 
 massive global network using our favourite tools and frameworks
 
 Virualization
-------------------------------
Azure Architecture
---Regions -region is a set of datacenters of one or more deployed within a latency-defined perimeter
            connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.
---Availability zones are available insid the regions upto 3 each availability zone containe itseft datacenters colings and netwroks
---Resource group ex( groups inside another group) Resource group-vnet-subnet-
                 -we group the subscriptions into management groups
				 -resources can exist in only one resource group
				 
---Azure Resource Manager (ASM)( it is totally in json format)we can aslo create vm using 
                    visual studio using arm template
---The Azure Architecture usage and benefits

Virtual machines vs containers
containers--docker engine is place of hypervisor
          --No os in case of containers
		  --More Containers as compared to vms
		  --Bins/libs can be shared in containers but not in vms
		  
		  
		  
---------------------------------------------------------------------
CapEx vs OPEx
buying a company vechile is an example of capEx
leaving a company vechile is an example of opEx
cloud comes under opex as is goes based on consumption

     Storage
 Iaas ----Disks
        --Block level storage volumes for azure vm's
      ----Files
	    --Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments
 Paas ----Blobs
        --Highly Scalable Rest based object store
		--videos,unstructured,binary data,serving images or doc directly to a browser
		--
      ----Tables --no sql
      ----Queues
        --Reliable queues at scale for cloud services or messaging between application components
Storage Tiers
  -Hot Tiers  --reqgular
  -Cool Tiers  -- 
  -Archive Tier 

LRS -Local Redundency service
ZRS -Zones
GRS -Global
RA-GRS

Access key for storage accounts
  -To get Access to the storage accounts using only Access key
for one storage there will be two keys
key rotation--it able to refresh the key and generates the new key
  
  Databases
  
Azure Cosmos DB
 --Globally disturbyted ,multi-model NoSQL database service
 --PaaS Service-Auto-Scalable Across multiple regions
 --Supports API,Including SQL,MongoDB
Azure SQL Database
 --Iaas
 --Paas 
Azure Data warehouse

Azure ServerLess Computing
-Azure Functions
-Azure Login Apps
-Azure Event Grid

 
 management of the cloud
 -automatically scale resource deployment based on need
 -Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template,removing the need for manualconfiguration
 -monitor the health of resoucres
 -recieve aitomatic alrerts based on configured metrics

 Core Architectural Components of Azure
 
 vm vs container
 vm -no os
 container --having os
 
  container -container engine-
Exprees route lets you to extend on premises networks into the microsoft cloud over a private connection
Expree route uses Border Gateway Protocol(BGP) to exchange route between on-premises networks and resources 
  running in azure
-  
Azure DNS
-Is a hosting servcice for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using microsoft azure infrastructre

  
  
  Storage
-
Going for Network file system(NFS) use the premium file shares account type


Azure Storage redundancy
Data in azure storage account is always replicated three times in the primary region 
Azure storage offers two options for how data is replicated in the primary region -LRS and ZRS
LRS -11 nines of durability 99.999999999
if datacenter fails storage present in LRS may be lost and unrecoverable.To mange this use ZRS,GRS, or GZRS
ZRS -12 nines
  
Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region for scenarios that require high availability. 
ZRS is also recommended for restricting replication of data within a country or region to meet data governance requirements.

GRS --16 nines

GZRS -data in GZRS storage account is copied across three azure availability zones in the primary region 
and is also replicated to a a secondary region

Defences in Depth
Physical Security
  -Controlling access to computing hardware within the datacenter are the first line of defence
Identity and Access
  -This access is granted only to whats needed and that sign-in events and changes are logged
  -Control access to infrastructure and change control
  -USe SSO and multipfactor authentication
Perimeter
  -This protects from network-based attacks agoinst your resources
  -Use DDos protection to filter large sacale attacks before they can affect the availability of a system
  -use perimeter firewalls to identify and alert on malicious attacks against your network
Network
  -

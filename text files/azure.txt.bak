Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services
AZure fundamentals is a series of six learning paths
Cloud computing
 It's the delivery of computing services over the network
 which includes servers, storage,databases,networking
      (screentshot)
	  container engine after the hypervisor
	  in hypervisor we need to do patching ,migration and many more
	  in container we dont need to any it convert into a package 
	  hypervisor,comtainer,serverless runtime
	  serverless runtime ---function
	Cloud services Benefits
	-Scalability and elastibility
	-High Availability
    -Fault tolerance
	-Disaster recovery in azure we call as service recovery
	
	On-premises--we can manage when we are having data centers (i.e in our office we having total data servers or own cooling systems)
	             we are responsible for everything total         
	Iaas--like os,vms,cpu(we need to choose which os to use ) (providing servers or switches or storage or networking in high availability )ex google,aws
	             Ex.In this we are taking a a place to place our own os or middeware (the place is just like server or networking)
			   --host
	Paas--like developers,deployers
	             in this how the application is running
	Saas--like business users
	             in this they are having total responsibility
				 ex office365. 
	 
	  
	
	
	public cloud--
	prons-
	
	private cloud--
	hybrid  cloud--
	
    Virtual machine Scale sets (VMSS)(it will increase or decrease automatically)	
	
	 whenever the cpu is using some memory i.e more then it will automatically create another vms

Azure
 Azure gives us the freedom to build ,manage and deploy applications on a 
 massive global network using our favourite tools and frameworks
 
 Virualization
-------------------------------
Azure Architecture
---Regions -region is a set datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter
            connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.
---Availability zones
---Resource group ex( groups inside another group) Resource group-vnet-subnet-
                 -we group the subscription s into management groups
				 
---Azure Resource Manager (ASM)( it is totally in json format)we can aslo create vm using 
                    visual studio using arm template
---The Azure Architecture usage and benefits

Virtual machines vs containers
containers--docker engine is place of hypervisor
          --No os in case of containers
		  --More Containers as compared to vms
		  --Bins/libs can be shared in containers but not in vms

Dependency Injection in .Net Core:

DI is a DEsign  Pattern
DEsign Pattern ?
-BAL,DAL,PL,..->it's a problem
MVC architecture=> Solution to the above problem
MVC is a design pattern

DI covers Tightly coupled vs Lossely coupled
Class must be acts as lossely coupled

For converting tightly coupled into loosely coupled we have some principles
1.Inversion of control principle
2.Dependency Inversion principle

Inversion of control (IOC)
-Invert the application control flow
-there should not be any direct dependency between classes
-we had inverted the control of creating instance

Dependency Inversion principle(DIP)
-High level modules does not depend on low level module
   -High level module means who are using other classes data
-Both modules should be depend on abstractions.
    -Abstarctions in which we cannot create objects
